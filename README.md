## Dusty - Render simple particle simulations
I am currently cleaning up my disks and I found this project I created way back in something like 2017.
I made some music and was looking for a way to generate a particle simulation for the background of videos.
So I made this tool.

And [This](https://youtu.be/npXttTeTF60) is a music video which uses a particle simulation made with _Dusty_.
