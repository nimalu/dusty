## Dusty - Render simple particle simulations
I am currently cleaning up my disks and I found this project I created way back in something like 2017.
I was making some music and was looking for a way to generate a particle simulation for the background of the video.
So I made this tool.

[Here](https://youtu.be/HKrrOt2tnAI) you can see a short teaser I made back then. 
And [This](https://youtu.be/npXttTeTF60) is a music video which uses a particle simulation made with _Dusty_.
